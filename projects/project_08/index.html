			<p><strong>Molding a Pumpkin</strong></p>
					<p></p>
					<img src="../../Images/Week 8/imageofbluemold" alt="Project 05" />
					<p>I started this week by designing a mold for a pumpkin. I had to
						split the mold into two parts because we can no CNC on the underside
						of a sphere.</p>
					<img src="../../Images/Week 8/IMG_0426.JPG" alt="Project 05" />
					<p>Once the mold was finished I mixed the Silicon. At first I
						accedently mixed SortaClear becasue it went I went to gra the oomoo,
						it was sitting next to it. Becuse of this I had to wait 4 hours for
						 it to cure instead of the 75 min. </p>
					<img src="../../Images/Week 8/IMG_0429.JPG" alt="Project 05" />
					<p>I finally did pur oomoo instead ecasue I was curious aout the
						differences in the materials. The oomoo was much squishier.
						Pictured is my Wax as well as my molding in oth oomoo and sortaclear.
					</p>
					<img src="../../Images/Week 8/IMG_0430.JPG" alt="Project 05" />
					<p>I found out that the Sorta Clear was food safe so I decided to try
						and cast my mold in chocolate. I know that its technically not food
						safe ecasue the wax is not ut I washed it out a unch and did some
						practice ones to get rid of the residuals. I also just wanted to try
						it and might never actually eat one.</p>
			<p><strong>Molding my Brass Rat</strong></p>
								<p></p>
								<img src="../../Images/Week 8/IMG_0427.JPG" alt="Project 05" />
								<p>I started this project because I wanted to make my Brass Rat
									out of actual Brass. First I put my real ring on a spru and
									surounded the whole thing with plastic and metal.</p>
								<img src="../../Images/Week 8/IMG_0428.JPG" alt="Project 05" />
								<p>I then pured the silicon mixture. The silicon I was working
									with was Mold Max 29 which used 100:10 ratio by weight. </p>
								<img src="../../Images/Week 8/Final Brass Rat photot" alt="Project 05" />
								<p>After weighting for that to cure, I removed the silicon from
									the case and cut along the spru antul I could get my ring out.
									Next I will shoot wax into the silcon mold and once that dries
									spru it again to a larger spru and place it in investment to
									be cast in Brass.
								</p>
