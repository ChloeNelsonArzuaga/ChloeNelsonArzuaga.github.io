			<p><strong>Creating a Motion Detector</strong></p>
					<p>This week I decided to create a motion detector so that I could implement it in final project.</p>
					<img src="../../Images/Week 9/IMG_0435.JPG" alt="Project 05" />
					<p>I began by working off of the board that Neil had for the HC-SR501 and
						 added an LED and Resistor so that I could make it blink when motion
						 was detected. One problem I had was that I could not find the pads
						 for the sensor in Eagle so I instead used the pads for a 3 pad switch
						 that seemed to be the same size.</p>
					<img src="../../Images/Week 9/IMG_0437.JPG" alt="Project 05" />
					<p>I ran into a couple of problems when I went to mill my board.
						The first error was that my stock was not level so some of the board
						 cut and the rest did not. </p>
					<img src="../../Images/Week 9/IMG_0438.JPG" alt="Project 05" />
					<p>After that error I pressed down the other side of the board more
						and decided to run the file again on top of the first run because
						I still had my zero and did not want to wast material. Unfortunatly
						my board began to move becasue the tape was not strong enough and I
						got a cut through the middle of my traces.</p>
					<img src="../../Images/Week 9/IMG_0439.JPG" alt="Project 05" />
					<p>Finally I was able to cut my board out and solder all of the
						components onto it and then it was time to program it.</p>
					<img src="../../Images/Week 9/IMG_0441.JPG" alt="Project 05" />
					<p>I wrote the code above using the conversion between arduino digital
						 pins and the pins of ATTiny. I had a bit of a problem becasue my LED
						 was originally in backwards but once I switched the LED everything
						 worked great.</p>
					<video controls>

					</video>
					<p>The motion sensor worked!!! My only issue is that even with the
						time delay turned all the way down there was still a 3 second period
						where the sensor could not detect motion.</p>
