			<p><strong>Electronic Design of a Hello World Board</strong></p>
					<p>This week we were tasked with recreating a hello world board and
						adding an LED and Button to it. This week was particularly
						challenging for me becasue I had never done electronics design
						before and my only electronics manufacturng experience was from a
						couple weeks ago in this class. I also spent a bit of time working
						on my how to make something big for next week so I did not have as
						much time to work on this weeks project.</p>
					<img src="../../Images/Week 5/Screen Shot 2019-10-09 at 1.07.15 AM.png" alt="Project 05" />
					<p>I started this weeks project by reading over tutorials and watching
						plenty of videos on how to use Eagle, the software needed to make
						the circuit board. Once I felt slightly comfortable with the
						software (it was still totally confusing), I began to insert my
						components. I used Neil's image above as a reference.</p>
					<img src="../../Images/Week 5/Screen Shot 2019-10-09 at 1.00.55 AM.png" alt="Project 05" />
					<p>One thing that took me a while to realize was that I needed to
						download the fab library (fab.lb) that had all the components I
						needed. Prior to that I was trying to find them all in the already
						downloaded libaries. Once I figured that out it was a lot easier
						to find all of the components and place them in the scematic. </p>
					<img src="../../Images/Week 5/Screen Shot 2019-10-09 at 1.39.30 AM.png" alt="Project 05" />
					<p>Once I had all of the components in the scematic, I started to
					connect them with wires. One thing that I found very annoying was the
					fact that the micro-controllers pins were not in the same layout on the scematic
					so I had a lot of wires crossing. I am a bit of a perfectionist and
					so I wanted to get this part as perfect as I could so it took quite a while.
					</p>
					<img src="../../Images/Week 5/Screen Shot 2019-10-09 at 1.44.19 AM.png" alt="Project 05" />
					<p>After all of my work placing things perfectly in the scematic,
						I was a little sad when I clicked convert ot board and all of my
						components stacked on top of eachother. It took a lot of time to
						get them back where I originally wanted them to go.</p>
					<img src="../../Images/Week 5/Screen Shot 2019-10-09 at 2.33.21 AM.png" alt="Project 05" />
					<p>Finally I got them all back to where I wanted them and drew in the
						wires becasue all of the yellow lines were just straight shots from
						one component to another which ment that a lot of them were crossed
						over. Unfortunatly I did not have enought time to actually make the
						board becasue I ran into a lot of problems on the design side but
						 will come back an finish it at a later time.</p>
