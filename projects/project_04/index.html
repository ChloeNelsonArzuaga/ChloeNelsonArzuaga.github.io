			<p><strong>3D Printing Chainmail</strong></p>
					<p>This week we were tasked with 3D printing something that could not
						be made by using a subtractive method. I make chainmail by manually
						connecting each individual link and was curious if I could 3D print
						the links already together.</p>
					<img src="../../Images/Week 4/Screen Shot 2019-10-01 at 1.31.38 PM.png" alt="Project 01" />
					<p>I began this process by creating one ring. The dimensions of this
						ring were .04 diameter and a 5/16 ID. I chose these dimensions
						becasue they are the dimensions of the rings I currently have.</p>
					<img src="../../Images/Week 4/Screen Shot 2019-10-01 at 1.32.23 PM.png" alt="Project 01" />
					<p>4-1 Chainmail is a repeating pattern of 5 links with 1 center ring
						and 4 rings around it. There are many different types of patterns
						used for chainmail but I chose this one becasue I am the most
						familiar with the pattern. Becasue of this I made an assembly in
						SolidWorks with the 5 rings angled at 45 degrees to try and make
						the printing process easier.</p>
					<img src="../../Images/Week 4/Screen Shot 2019-10-01 at 1.32.53 PM.png" alt="Project 01" />
					<p>I then made an assembly with two of the sets of 5 rings and
						connected then vertically with another ring.</p>
					<img src="../../Images/Week 4/Screen Shot 2019-10-01 at 1.33.15 PM.png" alt="Project 01" />
					<p>I then connected two of them side by side with 3 rings to get what
						I actually wanted to print. Going forward I could create as many
						iterations of this pattern but I wanted my print to be done
						relativly quickly so I stuck to 4 of my sets of 5</p>
					<img src="../../Images/Week 4/IMG_0386.JPG" alt="Project 01" />
					<p>Finally it was time to print! I knew that my rings were vary thin
						and on the egde of what would print but I wanted to try it anyway.
						The Rings printed but they were so thin that the printer head was
						constantly leaving strands and the supports were adheared stronger
						than the rest of the ring so taking off the supports was all but
						impossible.</p>
					<img src="../../Images/Week 4/IMG_0388.JPG" alt="Project 01" />
					<p>I then went back to by CAD files and increased the thickness of
						my rings to a little more than half the original thickness. The
						rings were parametrically defined so all I havd to do was change
						one dimension and the assemblies updated as well.  I then printed
						this new file and ran into an isue that 2 of the rings were merged
						because I had not left enough space between the rings to account
						for the inaccuracy of the printer.</p>

				<p><strong>Scanning</strong></p>
					<p>I decided to try and scan my phone for the scanning section of
						this weeks assignment. I put the phone on a swivle chair so that
						I coul move it around and capture it from multiple angles. I got
						the scan to work but to me it looks more like a cake that someone
						tried to make look like a phone. Overall I was not to impressed
						with the quality of the scan that came out.</p>
