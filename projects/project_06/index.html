			<p><strong>Creating a Foldable structure</strong></p>
					<p>This week we were tasked with making something big. I decided to
						make a foldale structure that when exapanded was the size of a
						twin sized bed and when folded was the size of a suitcase. I started
						by cading everything in SolidWorks. </p>
					<img src="../../Images/Week 6/IMG_0395.JPG" alt="Project 05" />
					<p>From my cad drawings I laser cut a quater size model so that I
						could work out some of the design kinks before moving to the OSB. I
						found that there was a crack that I had no though aout in the folded
						out design and tried to minimize it in the future designs.</p>
					<img src="../../Images/Week 6/IMG_0401.JPG" alt="Project 05" />
					<p>Finally I got to actually cutting my design out of OSB. The cutting
						went smoothly except for one pocket that did not get cut. Cleaning
						the OSB took a vary long time (like 6 hours alone to sand) that I
						was not expecting. Once all of the wood was clean it also took a
						while to screw in all the hinges and make all of the joints press
						together nicely. </p>
					<img src="../../Images/Week 6/IMG_0400.JPG" alt="Project 05" />
					<p>I then made a cart so that the structure would e easier to move
						around that was the correct size. It still took almost an hour to
						get it home from the N51 shop. I also made a tale that acted as
						stailization for the top of the structure when it was folded.
					</p>
					<img src="../../Images/Week 6/fabric.jpg" alt="Project 05" />
					<p>Going forward I want to add faric and tent poles to the top of the
						folded out structure so it actually encloses you. as well as a soft
						carpert that I have for the floor so it is comfortale.</p>
