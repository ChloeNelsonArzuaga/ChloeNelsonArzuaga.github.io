			<p><strong>Creating a Programer</strong></p>
					<p>This week there was not as much creativity in our designs.
						We were given the outline of what we were suposed to make.
					  I still really enjoyed this week because I do not know very
						much (anything) about creating PCB's and was excited to make my own
						and solder it.</p>
					<img src="../../Images/Week 3/IMG_0366.JPG" alt="Project 01" />
					<p>This was what my PCB looked like when it came out of the machine
						and after I had vacumed away the extra dust that was caused by the
						cutting. As you can see on the right most edge, my PCB is missing
						part of the design. This is because when I zeroed the x Axis I
						wanted to use as little wast as possible so I tried to guestimate
						how far it should be but was off by a small amount. Luckly the part
						of the PCB that I am missing does not have any wires so it is not
						that significant and I did not have to recut the PCB (thankfully
						becasue it actually took a lot longer than I expected it to becasue
						it had so many passes that it had to make). </p>
					<img src="../../Images/Week 3/IMG_0368.JPG" alt="Project 01" />
					<p>Finally I got around to actually soldering the components to the
						board. The image above is what my board looked like when it was
						cleaned up (the extra small peices of copper were removed) and the
						bottom image is what my final programmer looked like after all of
						the components were soldered on. It was a challenge to solder all
						of the peices onto the board
						because of how small they all were. While we had magnifying glasses,
						I would continously bump my hand against them and have to wait a
						while for them to stop shacking so that I could see my peices again.
						Also for some reason, I could only clearly see the peices thru the
						magnifying glass with one eye closed (otherwise I would see double
						and it would make my eyes hurt)</p>
